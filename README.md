# Deep Learning Specialization

## Course-1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

It includes-

### 1) Python Basics with NumPy:
- Learn how to use numpy.
- Implement some basic core deep learning functions such as the softmax, sigmoid, dsigmoid, etc...
- Learn how to handle data by normalizing inputs and reshaping images.
- Recognize the importance of vectorization.
- Understand how python broadcasting works.

### 2) Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset:
- build a cat classifier, using image recognition algorithm, that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy.
- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.
- Learn how to minimize the cost function.
- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.

### 3) Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer:
- generate red and blue points to form a flower, and then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points.
- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

### 4) Deep Neural Network Application:
- implement a Deep NN
- perform Image Classification
- improve the performance compared to the Logistic Regression model
